# Eucalyptus pauciflora NLR genes

The identification NB-ARC domains was conducted using an iterative process based on previous DNA Hidden Markov Models (HMM). An initial training list of E. grandis HMM profiles was used to extract TIR-NB-ARC and non-TIR-NB-ARC homologs in the E.pauciflora genome.

See *"ProjectCode.txt"* for the specific pipeline.
See *"Outputs.txt"* for results.
